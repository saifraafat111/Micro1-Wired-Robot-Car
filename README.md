This project is a part of "Principles of Microprocessors" course in the study plan for **Electric Power and Machines (EPM)** engineering students at Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University.

This project is about making a functional car with a joystick wired controller using ATmega328P and applying our own drivers.

## Objective

Our objective was to build a functional car that can be controlled using wired joystick. The car also have a battery indicator function that detects if the overall voltage of the batteries drops to a certain level which is 8V as the motors can function in voltages between 7:12 VDC.
